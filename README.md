# Privacy Policy for Prospecting Helper

_Last updated: [August 4, 2025]_

## Overview

Prospecting Helper is a custom discord bot designed to assist users of the Prospecting! community, including guides and commands to assist users on their prospecting journey.

We value user privacy and transparency. This bot does **not** collect, log, or store any personal user data unless explicitly required by certain features.


## Data Collected

By default, this bot does **not collect or store**:
- Usernames, IDs, or profile information
- Server data


The bot processes message data only in real-time (e.g., to respond to commands like `!help`) and does not log or retain that data.

## Opt-Out

Since no personal data is stored by default, no action is needed to opt out. If custom features are enabled that involve data storage, users can disable them or contact the developer for removal.

## Contact

For questions or data deletion requests, please contact the developer:
